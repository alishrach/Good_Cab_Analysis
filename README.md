**GoodCabs Data Analysis Project**

**Introduction**

This project involves analyzing operational and performance data from GoodCabs, a taxi service company operating across tier-2 cities. The analysis leverages both SQL and Python for data querying, transformation, and visualization, combined with Power BI dashboards to present actionable insights. The project addresses key business metrics, passenger trends, trip performance, and revenue growth, providing recommendations for operational improvements.

**Problem Statement**

GoodCabs aims to optimize its operations and enhance customer satisfaction by addressing:

Low trip counts and revenue in certain cities.

High variance in trip demand across weekdays and weekends.

Meeting trip and passenger targets across cities.

Identifying seasonal patterns and peak months for trip demand.

Evaluating city-specific revenue contributions and repeat passenger retention rates.
